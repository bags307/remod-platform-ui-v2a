# Active Context

## Current Focus
1. **Platform UI Development**
   - Building core management interface
   - Implementing flow visualization
   - Setting up authentication flows

2. **Recent Changes**
   - Established project structure
   - Implemented authentication with Supabase
   - Created flow visualization components
   - Set up basic routing and layouts

3. **Next Steps**
   - Complete organization management interface
   - Integrate Neo4j connection management
   - Add Pinecone vector store configuration
   - Implement MCP server monitoring

## Active Decisions
1. **UI Architecture**
   - Using React Flow for agent visualization
   - Implementing custom node types for different components
   - Building modular sidebar for tool management

2. **State Management**
   - Separate stores for auth, UI, and flow state
   - Local component state for isolated UI interactions
   - Centralized flow management through Zustand

3. **Integration Strategy**
   - Direct database connections during development
   - API gateway routing for production
   - Secure credential management

## Current Patterns
1. **Component Organization**
   - Nodes directory for flow components
   - Shared components for common UI elements
   - Page-level components for routes

2. **Styling Approach**
   - Consistent color schemes per component type
   - Gradient backgrounds for visual hierarchy
   - Interactive elements with hover states

3. **Data Flow**
   - Centralized authentication state
   - Flow data managed through React Flow
   - Configuration stored in Supabase
