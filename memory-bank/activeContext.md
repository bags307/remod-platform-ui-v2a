# Active Context

## Current Focus
1. **Platform UI Development**
   - Building core management interface
   - Implementing application management
   - Building responsive list/grid views
   - Creating reusable components
   - Adding notifications system UI

2. **Recent Changes**
   - Added Applications dashboard
   - Created ApplicationList component with dual view modes
   - Implemented ApplicationCard component
   - Added UserHeader component
   - Extended UI store for view mode management
   - Added UserDropdown component

3. **Next Steps**
   - Implement notifications system
     - Create NotificationsDropdown component
     - Add notifications timeline page
     - Support multiple notification types
     - Add notification preferences
   - Add application CRUD operations
   - Add application filtering
   - Add application deployment flow

   - Integrate Neo4j connection management
   - Add Pinecone vector store configuration
   - Implement MCP server monitoring

## Active Decisions
1. **UI Architecture**
   - Dual view modes (list/grid) for applications
   - Consistent component patterns
   - Reusable header and navigation

2. **State Management**
   - Separate stores for auth, UI, and flow state
   - Route-specific preferences managed with local state
   - Global UI store simplified to core app-wide settings
   - View mode preferences isolated to route components

3. **Integration Strategy**
   - Direct database connections during development
   - API gateway routing for production
   - Secure credential management

## Current Patterns
1. **Component Organization**
   - Nodes directory for flow components
   - Shared components for common UI elements
   - Page-level components for routes

2. **Styling Approach**
   - Consistent color schemes per component type
   - Gradient backgrounds for visual hierarchy
   - Interactive elements with hover states

3. **Data Flow**
   - Centralized authentication state
   - Flow data managed through React Flow
   - Configuration stored in Supabase
