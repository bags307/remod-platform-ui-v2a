# Active Context

## Current Focus
1. **Platform UI Development**
   - Building core management interface
   - Implementing application management
   - Building responsive list/grid views
   - Creating reusable components
  - Implementing notifications system

2. **Recent Changes**
  - Added notifications UI components
  - Created notifications page with filtering
  - Added notification actions (star, save, dismiss)
  - Added expandable notification details
   - Added Applications dashboard
   - Created ApplicationList component with dual view modes
   - Implemented ApplicationCard component
   - Added UserHeader component
   - Extended UI store for view mode management
   - Added UserDropdown component

3. **Next Steps**
  - Complete notifications system backend:
    - Create database schema and migrations
    - Implement notification API endpoints
    - Add WebSocket subscriptions
    - Integrate with Supabase
    - Add notification preferences UI
   - Add application CRUD operations
   - Add application filtering
   - Add application deployment flow

   - Integrate Neo4j connection management
   - Add Pinecone vector store configuration
   - Implement MCP server monitoring

## Active Decisions
1. **UI Architecture**
   - Dual view modes (list/grid) for applications
   - Consistent component patterns
   - Reusable header and navigation
  - Expandable notification details with metadata
  - Real-time notification updates via WebSocket

2. **State Management**
   - Separate stores for auth, UI, and flow state
   - Route-specific preferences managed with local state
   - Global UI store simplified to core app-wide settings
   - View mode preferences isolated to route components
  - Notification state managed through Supabase

3. **Integration Strategy**
   - Direct database connections during development
   - API gateway routing for production
   - Secure credential management
  - WebSocket for real-time notifications

## Current Patterns
1. **Component Organization**
   - Nodes directory for flow components
   - Shared components for common UI elements
   - Page-level components for routes

2. **Styling Approach**
   - Consistent color schemes per component type
   - Gradient backgrounds for visual hierarchy
   - Interactive elements with hover states

3. **Data Flow**
   - Centralized authentication state
   - Flow data managed through React Flow
   - Configuration stored in Supabase
